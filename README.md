The Odin Project's Bubble Sort

Check out this video from Harvard’s CS50x on Bubble Sort: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kp-8OGwphY

Assignment:

Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array. It must use the bubble sort methodology (using #sort would be pretty pointless, wouldn’t it?).

> bubble_sort([4,3,78,2,0,2])
=> [0,2,2,3,4,78]
